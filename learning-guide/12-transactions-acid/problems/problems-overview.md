# Transactions and ACID - Practice Problems

## Problem 1: Basic Transactions
1. Money transfer between accounts (ACID demo)
2. Multi-table insert with rollback
3. Error handling in transactions
4. Savepoints for partial rollback
5. Nested transaction simulation

## Problem 2: Isolation Levels
1. Demonstrate READ COMMITTED behavior
2. Show REPEATABLE READ snapshot
3. Test SERIALIZABLE conflicts
4. Compare isolation level effects
5. Handle serialization failures

## Problem 3: Locking
1. Use FOR UPDATE to lock rows
2. Implement queue processing with SKIP LOCKED
3. Handle concurrent updates
4. Prevent lost updates
5. Optimistic vs pessimistic locking

## Problem 4: Deadlock Scenarios
1. Create intentional deadlock
2. Detect and handle deadlocks
3. Prevent deadlocks with lock ordering
4. Retry logic for deadlock victims
5. Monitor deadlock frequency

## Problem 5: Concurrency Control
1. Implement version-based concurrency
2. Counter updates without lost updates
3. Concurrent inventory management
4. Ticket booking system
5. Rate limiting with transactions

## Problem 6: Transaction Patterns
1. Saga pattern for distributed transactions
2. Idempotent operations
3. Two-phase commit
4. Compensating transactions
5. Batch processing with commits
