# Subqueries - Practice Problems

## Problem 1: Scalar Subqueries
1. Find employees earning more than company average
2. Products priced above category average
3. Orders above monthly average
4. Students scoring above class average
5. Salespeople exceeding their team average

## Problem 2: IN and NOT IN Subqueries
1. Customers who placed orders
2. Products never ordered
3. Employees in departments with > 10 people
4. Orders containing specific products
5. Students enrolled in any science course

## Problem 3: EXISTS and NOT EXISTS
1. Customers with at least one order
2. Products in stock but never sold
3. Employees managing others
4. Departments with no employees
5. Orders with all items delivered

## Problem 4: Correlated Subqueries
1. Each product with its category rank
2. Employees earning top 3 in department
3. Latest order for each customer
4. Running totals by category
5. Find records with no matching child records

## Problem 5: Subqueries in FROM (Derived Tables)
1. Aggregate results then filter
2. Pre-filtered joins
3. Multiple aggregation levels
4. Complex calculations as base for further queries

## Problem 6: Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
1. Multiple CTEs for complex queries
2. Recursive CTE for hierarchy
3. CTE for data transformation pipeline
4. Use CTE to avoid repeating subqueries
