# Learn the Basics - Practice Problems

## Overview
These problems help you practice fundamental database concepts including table creation, relationships, and basic data types.

## Problems

### 01. Database Basics
**Difficulty:** Easy
**Topics:** Tables, Primary Keys, Foreign Keys, Basic Relationships
**File:** [01-database-basics.md](01-database-basics.md)

Create a library system with books, members, and borrowings tables. Practice creating tables, defining primary/foreign keys, and understanding one-to-many relationships.

### 02. Relationships
**Difficulty:** Easy
**Topics:** One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many
**File:** [02-relationships.md](02-relationships.md)

Build a school system demonstrating all three types of relationships: students↔profiles (1:1), teachers↔classes (1:N), students↔courses (M:N).

## Learning Path
1. Start with problem 01 to understand basic table structure
2. Move to problem 02 to learn about relationships
3. Try creating your own schemas for real-world scenarios

## Additional Practice
After completing these problems, try creating schemas for:
- E-commerce system (products, customers, orders)
- Social media platform (users, posts, comments, likes)
- Hospital management (patients, doctors, appointments)
- Movie database (movies, actors, directors, genres)

## Tips
- Always define primary keys
- Use appropriate data types
- Name foreign keys clearly
- Draw ER diagrams before coding
- Test relationships with sample data
